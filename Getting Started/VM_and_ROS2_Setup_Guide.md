Provides overview of setting up ROS2 Humble within a Ubuntu 22.04 LTS VM

## Virtual Machine Setup 
ROS2 is intended to run in a linux envrionment. Unless you want Ubuntu 22.04 LTS as your daily OS I recommend setting up a VM. 

[Start downloading the desktop version of the OS](https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/)
### Windows

[Follow this tutorial for setting up an Ubuntu VM inside of Virtual Box](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-run-ubuntu-desktop-on-a-virtual-machine-using-virtualbox#1-overview)

### OSX

[Follow this tutorial for setting up an Ubuntu VM inside of VMware Fusion](https://dev.to/tchisom17/installing-linuxubuntu-on-a-virtual-machine-using-vmware-on-mac-ed)

### Before Moving forward
  * Run "sudo apt update" and "sudo apt upgrade"
  * Do NOT upgrade to Ubuntu 24.04
  * After the update, repeat this process until updates are complete, or no other updates remain.
